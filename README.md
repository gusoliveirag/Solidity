# 🏦 Decentralized Banking System (Smart Contract)

## 📖 About the Project
This project is a simulation of a **Decentralized Bank** built on the Ethereum Blockchain using **Solidity**. 

It demonstrates core concepts of Smart Contract development, including state management, financial transactions, and access control security. The goal was to create a trustless system where users can deposit, withdraw, and transfer assets securely.

## 🚀 Features
* **Secure Deposits:** Users can deposit ETH into the smart contract.
* **Owner Access Control:** Implementation of security modifiers to ensure only the owner can execute specific administrative actions.
* **Withdrawals:** Secure withdrawal mechanism preventing re-entrancy attacks (basic level).
* **Peer-to-Peer Transfers (Pix):** Users can transfer funds directly to other wallets through the contract logic.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
* **Language:** Solidity (v0.8.9)
* **Environment:** Remix IDE
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 💡 How to use
1.  Deploy the contract using Remix IDE (Injected Provider or VM).
2.  Deposit Ether using the `depositar` function.
3.  Check the balance updates on the Blockchain.
4.  Transfer funds to another wallet address using the `fazerPix` function.
